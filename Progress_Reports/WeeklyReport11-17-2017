This week we have successfully created a SAT solver model for our 2x2x2 cube. This was done by using a program called Sabr that transfers game rules into conductive normal form and use this form in SAT solvers miniSAT and Cadical. We still have some improvements that can be made to these models and we hope to do this and expand to the 3x3x3 cube shortly.

We have also nearly completed work on our spin model for the 2x2x2 cube. We have done this by assigning each square an integer value based on the initial condition. Then we model the transitions of the cube by reassigning the value of each square depending on the transition. We hope to also have this bug free soon. Then we decide if we want to use spin to represent the 3x3x3 cube.

Additionally, we completed our 2x2x2 SMV model and ran preliminary tests. What we found, given the amount of time it took to return results for simple LTL properties, is that there may be issues with our particular representation. In a (somewhat) naive way, the transitions are explicitly enumerated, which is the method that seems to be used in most of the Rubik's simulators appearing online. I (Josh) intend to  try collapsing the state space using techniques found in a 2006 paper on the topic.
